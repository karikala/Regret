		<h1>The only thing I regret.</h1>

		<p>I thought of explaing all the things that I went through in that 
			<em>nibba</em> dumbish part of my liffe. But at the same time I don't 
		want to make myself bad memorising the mistakes I have done.</p>

		<p>I want to share only on thing. I wasted my precious time. I invested
			my time and emotions in "not right" person and it was totally my mistake.
			All of a suddern in a random thought this will pop up and make feel like,
			I should have invested my time in gainging knowledge, may be I would be in a 
		better position than what I'm right now.</p>
